The Code of Conduct is a collection of rules and principles intended to assist employees and directors in making decisions about their conduct in relation to the firm’s business. The Code is based on the fundamental understanding that we are all responsible for conducting business ethically and in compliance with the law everywhere we operate. No one should ever sacrifice integrity — or give the impression that they have — even if they think it would help the firm’s business.
